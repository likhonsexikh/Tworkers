# Tworkers ü§ñ (Termux Edition)

An AI agent powered by Google's ADK, designed to run securely in a sandboxed Ubuntu environment on Termux.

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Termux-Native:** No Docker required. Uses `proot-distro` for a userland sandbox.
-   **Security First:** All file and command operations are sandboxed within a guest Ubuntu OS and controlled by a secure API layer.
-   **API-Driven Tools:** The AI agent cannot directly access the system. It uses hardened API endpoints for all actions, preventing unsafe behavior.
-   **Web Interface:** A clean, browser-based UI to interact with the agent and view the sandboxed file system.

### üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Tworkers runs a Flask web server inside a `proot-distro` Ubuntu instance. The ADK-based AI agent is loaded by the server. When a user sends a prompt through the web UI, the agent reasons and decides which tools to use. These "tools" are secure Python functions that perform the requested actions strictly within the sandboxed environment.
